# Web-client-and-server-web-set-up
This project is to set up a simple web (HTTP) server. The web server will be able to respond to requests from the web client as well as requests from commercial web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). However, as the web client only needed to support GET requests, the web server only responds successfully to GET requests(it still sends a response with an error status code if it receives any other methods).
